## üîÑ What This Endpoint Does

The endpoint automatically executes the following calculators in sequence:

### Milestone 1: Initialize Basic Data
1. **scenario_geo** - Initialize scenario geometry from project boundary
2. **building_geo** - Extract building geometries from OSM
3. **building_props** - Initialize building properties

### Milestone 2: Calculate Physical Attributes
4. **building_height** - Calculate building heights from DSM/DTM rasters
5. **building_area** - Calculate building footprint areas
6. **scenario_census_boundary** - Get census boundary for the scenario

### Milestone 3: Calculate Derived Attributes
7. **building_volume** - Calculate building volumes
8. **building_n_floors** - Estimate number of floors from height

### Milestone 4: Calculate Demographics
9. **census_population** - Get total population from census
10. **building_type** - Determine building types
11. **building_population** - Distribute population to buildings
12. **building_n_families** - Calculate number of families per building

### Milestone 5: Additional Attributes
13. **building_construction_year** - Estimate construction years
14. **building_demographic** - Calculate demographic details
15. **building_geo_lod12** - Generate LOD1/LOD2 3D geometries

## ‚ö° Key Features

1. **Automatic Chaining**: Each calculator automatically uses results from previous calculators
2. **Error Handling**: If a calculation fails, it continues with the rest and reports failures
3. **Progress Tracking**: Shows which calculations succeeded and which failed
4. **Summary Statistics**: Provides aggregate statistics for all calculated values
5. **No Manual Setup**: No need to create projects or scenarios manually - everything is automatic

## üéØ How It Works

1. **Input**: You provide just the project boundary GeoJSON
2. **Processing**: The endpoint:
   - Generates unique project and scenario IDs
   - Sets up the data context
   - Executes each calculator in the correct order
   - Passes results from one calculator to the next
3. **Output**: Complete analysis results with summary statistics

## üîß Testing in Postman

1. Create a new POST request
2. Set URL: `http://localhost:8000/api/pipeline/execute_complete_chain`
3. Set Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`
4. Copy the request body from above
5. Send the request
6. View the complete analysis results

## üìù Notes

- The endpoint uses hardcoded service URLs for raster and census services
- It assumes these services are running on the same host (localhost:8000)
- The calculation chain is predefined but comprehensive
- Each calculator has fallback methods if the primary method fails
- Results are not saved to database (can be added if needed)

## üö® Prerequisites

Make sure you have:
1. Database running: `sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.db.yml up -d`
2. Application running: `./start_app.sh dev`
3. Raster data loaded in the database
4. Census data available

## üí° Alternative: Custom Chain

If you want to execute only specific calculators, you can still use the other endpoints:
- `/api/pipeline/execute` - For automatic dependency resolution
- `/api/pipeline/execute_explicit` - For manual method specification
- `/api/pipeline/calculate_feature` - For single feature calculation

But this new `/execute_complete_chain` endpoint is the simplest way to get a complete analysis!
